## EE120 : Signal and System

The highlight of this course is the six interesting programming assignments that allow students to solve practical problems using the theoretical knowledge of signals and systems they have learned in Python.lab3, for example, lets students implement FFT algorithms and compare their performance with Numpy's official implementation;lab4 will analyze the finger image data to infer heart rate;lab5 goes even further, allowing students to de-noise Hubble images to restore bright, clear stars.lab6 will let you construct a feedback system that balances the thin rods on the trolley.
